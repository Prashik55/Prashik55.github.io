🚨 FRAUD ALERT – BE AWARE! 🚨

We were cheated by 🔴 Mr. Salim Karmali and Mrs. Jasbir Karmali from 🔴 FUTURE PACKS UNLIMITED, ALJ Residency, 103-a, 1st Floor,, Pali Naka, Bandra West,Mumbai - 400 050. Tel. : 9619900199/9819966199   email : futurepacksunlimited@gmail.com .

Despite making full advance payment, we received only 10–20% of the promised packaging material — and even that is completely unusable. The material is low-grade, unhygienic, and unfit for any food application.

We are officially rejecting this packaging material due to the following reasons:

❌ Non-compliance with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) – Dirty, poorly handled, and no batch traceability.
❌ Business Loss & Trust Breach – Delayed production, financial damage, and loss of trust.
❌ Severe Health Hazard – The material poses a risk to consumer health.
❌ Violation of FSSAI Guidelines – Not food-safe, fails basic compliance.


We warn all food manufacturers and brands to stay away from Mr. Salim Karmali and Mrs. Jasbir Karmali and FUTURE PACKS UNLIMITED. They operate with dishonesty, zero accountability, and a blatant disregard for public safety.

We are taking this up with all relevant authorities:

Ministry of Consumer Affairs

FSSAI – Food Safety and Standards Authority of India

BIS – Bureau of Indian Standards

MOFPI – Ministry of Food Processing Industries

State FDA (Food & Drug Administration)

We believe in clean business, quality materials, and consumer safety first.
